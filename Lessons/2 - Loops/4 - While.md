### Preamble #1: Shortcuts for Conditions

When a condition equates to `true` or `false` you do not need to use `== true` or `== false`.   
**Example:**  
```JS
if (is_even(8) == true) {
  ...
}

// Can be shortened:
if (is_even(8)) {
  ...
}
```

Similarly, the `return` statement can return the result of math or a condition:
```JS
function is_even(num) {
  return num % 2 == 0;
}
// üëÜüèª the value is determined first and then returned
```


### Preamble #2: isNaN

There is a JS built-in function called `isNaN()`. It returns _true_ if a value is **_not_** a number.
```JS
if (isNaN(my_value)) {
  console.log("That was not a number.");
} else {
  console.log("It was a number!");
}
```

### Lesson:

Copy/pasting your code is inefficient. You should always avoid having the same code multiple times.

Also we might not know when a situation will end:
```JS
// Ask the user to enter a number and check for valid input
let input = Number(prompt(‚ÄúEnter a number.‚Äù));

if (isNaN(input))
  input = Number(prompt(`Please enter a number.`));
    if (isNaN(input))
      input = Number(prompt(`Ugh, please enter a number.`));
        if (isNaN(input))
          input = Number(prompt(`Enter a NUMBER.`));
            if (isNaN(input))
              ... 

            // When will the insanity end?
```

For another example - imagine a guessing game from 1 to 1000 with as many guesses as you want. That's a **lot** of if-statements.

Programming languages have the ability to move back up to a specific line in the code.

        It's not as simple as saying "go back to line 12", but it's still pretty simple:

<span style="color:skyblue;">**Think of the condition _just like an if-statement_!**</span> The code will loop (repeat) and _continue_ to loop if (or _while_) the condition is `true`. Let's look at some examples:

### Examples

##### [Top ‚¨Ü](#34---while)

```JS
// A never-ending loop (this is not good)
while (1 == 1) {
  console.log("You can't stop me!");
}

// Counting to 10
let n = 0;
while (n <= 10) {
  console.log("n is", n);
  n++;    // üëàüèª Make sure to increase 'n'!
}

// Ask the user for their name
let input = prompt("What is your name?");
while (input.length == 0) {
  input = prompt("Sorry, I didn't catch that. What is your name?");
}

// Roll until snake eyes
let die1 = randInt(1, 6);
let die2 = randInt(1, 6);
let count = 1;
while (die1 != 1 && die2 != 1) {
  die1 = randInt(1, 6);
  die2 = randInt(1, 6);
  count += 1;
}
console.log(`Rolled snake eyes after ${count} rolls.`);
```

### Practice Time!

##### [Top ‚¨Ü](#34---while)

All three of these functions will be run from the console. **They are in no particular order.**

**Note** - if you struggle with the functions below, see your teacher for simpler examples / tasks.

#### Countdown

###### [Top ‚¨Ü](#34---while)

`countdown(start, stop)`: this function will count down from the `start` value to the `stop` value.
  - Before you loop, make sure `start > stop`.
    - If not, return -1.
  - When the loop finishes, the function should _return_ **the number of times it looped** (how many numbers it printed).  

    For Example:
    ```txt
    countdown(9, 4)
    9
    8
    7
    6
    5
    4
    6   << That's the return value
    ```
<br>


#### Random Until Stop

###### [Top ‚¨Ü](#34---while)

`random_until(min, max, stop)`: this function will...

  - check that `max` is _greater_ than `min`. If not, return -1;
  - check that `stop` is between (or equal to) `min` and `max`. If not, return -1;
  - generate a random number from `min` to `max`. Print it to the console.
    - _Repeat this process as long as the random number is not equal to_ `stop`;
  - return `stop`.  
    Example:
    ```txt
    random_until(5, 15, 7)
    6
    10
    8
    8
    5
    11
    5
    12
    7   << That's the return value
    ```
<br>

#### Average

###### [Top ‚¨Ü](#34---while)

`average(n)` - this function _prompts_ the user for `n` values and then calculates the average, rounded to 1 decimal. It should behave like this:
   ```txt
   average(5)
   Please enter value 1/5 > 6
   Please enter value 2/5 > 4
   Please enter value 3/5 > 2
   Please enter value 4/5 > 4
   Please enter value 5/5 > 12
   The average is 5.6
   ```
    It is safe to assume proper input - _no need to check that it's a valid number_.

### "Sir, I'm feeling a little lost or behind the rest of the class."

There's no shame in that! Coding is hard. Come and see me, I'll try to assist you however I can. I'm also hoping to have some extra practice tasks in the future.

### "Sir, this is too easy for me - I'm kind of bored in your class."

Being bored is healthy - it breeds creativity. Get creative! You have the ability to make websites with HTML and CSS. You also know how to make the website interactive with JavaScript.
