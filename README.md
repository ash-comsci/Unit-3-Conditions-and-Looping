# Unit 3 - Conditionals and Loops

##### ICS3 - Mr. Brash üêøÔ∏è


So far we have the ability to create webpages using **HTML**, modify the webpage using **JavaScript**, chunk our code into **functions**, and use the **dev console** for printing and debugging.

### ü§î What if I need the code to _decide_ something?

> **Example:** Tell the user whether they are old enough to drive based on their age.

This is called a **_condition_**. You are permitted to drive a vehicle on the _condition_ that you meet the age requirement.

#### Lessons:

1. [The If-Statement](./Lessons/1%20-%20Conditionals/1%20-%20IF.md)
2. [The Else-If Statement](./Lessons/1%20-%20Conditionals/2%20-%20Else-If.md)
3. [The Else Statement](./Lessons/1%20-%20Conditionals/3%20-%20Else.md)

### ü§î What if I need the code to _repeat_ something?

> **Example:** Ask the user their age but they type words, a negative value, or they enter nothing. You want to ask them again.

Repeating a section of code is called a **_loop_**. The code goes back to a certain line number and runs code _again_ **until** a certain **condition** is met.
